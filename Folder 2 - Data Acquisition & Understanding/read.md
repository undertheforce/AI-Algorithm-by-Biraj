Statement of Work V2:
  Perform exploratory data analysis to identify main characteristics within the data. Determine preliminary data manipulations requirements (i.e. harmonize, rescale and/or clean). Perform statistical analysis to identify data patterns and correlations. 
  Discuss the benefits of feature engineering for optimal model output. Identify key candidate features between synthesized and real data for model input.
